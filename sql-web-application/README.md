## Features

* Copy results from one database type to another, (eg. PostgreSQL to MySQL,) translating data types as needed 
* Email notifications and alerts based on query execution status and conditions in results data
* Scheduled query execution
* Scheduled workflows of arbitrary sequences of operations
* Query execution metadata allows warnings and alerts about long-running queries, bad query patterns
